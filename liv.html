    <h1>Living Room</h1>

    <p>Feel free to decorate the place. It is your house after all, and the space </p>
    <p>you live in should be a reflection of the self. Keep things fresh from time </p>
    <p>to time, changing where things are placed, spaced or hung. Change out old </p>
    <p>furniture for new, or something old and sentimental, if it looks good just as it is.</p>
